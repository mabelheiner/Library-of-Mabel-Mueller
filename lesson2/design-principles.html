        I completed the lab: BigQuery: Qwik Start - Command Line. I have rarely run queries in the command line and I think I do not appreciate it as much as I should. The queries that I ran in this lab were efficient and useful. I like how the tables are displayed. It was nice to see how to upload a new dataset from a file in the command line. The one thing that I noticed the most was the speed of these queries even though they were small, this was much faster than using the Studios.
